## Description

The **Stage 2 Bases Indicator** helps traders visualize and identify **advancing base structures** during Stage 2 — the most profitable phase in Mark Minervini’s stock market cycle. It marks, measures, and tracks consolidation patterns within an uptrend to help traders spot potential breakout setups.

## What is Stage 2?

- Stage 2 = Advancing Phase in Mark Minervini’s stock market cycle.  
- Stocks in Stage 2 are in an uptrend (50 > 150 > 200-day moving averages).  
- This is where big winners form and compound returns.

---

## What is a Stage 2 Base?

- A pause (consolidation) in an ongoing uptrend.  
- Price moves sideways for weeks to months after an advance.  
- Builds energy for the next leg up and allows accumulation.  
- Strong prior uptrend before the base.  
- Moving averages aligned bullishly (50 > 150 > 200).  
- Base length typically 4+ weeks.  
- Base depth generally 10–40% pullback.  
- Volume contracts during consolidation.  
- Breakout occurs above prior highs on strong volume.

---

## Why They Matter

- Institutions accumulate shares during the base.  
- Resets overbought conditions without breaking the trend.

## Limitations

Base markings stop when **200 SMA > 50 SMA**, but if a stock remains strong within the base and doesn’t drop more than **40%**, it’s still worth watching.  
This scenario is not handled by the indicator.
