I am a professional software developer with a deep passion for the stock market. Both of these interests occupy much of my time. Apart from coding and trading, I enjoy playing cricket and writing Pine scripts. I am known for my laziness, which has driven me to automate most of my work. I am also a DIY enthusiast.

Here you will find my:
1. Automations
2. TradingView Indicators
3. Screeners
4. Trades
